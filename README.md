# TIC-TAC-TOE THREE IN A ROW

## Rules of the game

Tic-tac-toe is a game played in a 3x3 square.
You and your opponent must take turns putting your symbols in the empty squares.
The first player to have a full row of their symbols (in any orientation) wins!
If the board is filled and no player has a full row of 3 symbols, it is a tie!

## Planning Story

I had originally intended to create the game with a very minimalistic approach.
I wanted the board and some buttons, nothing more. The first thing I did was
create a wireframe to have an idea of how the page was going to look.

My main focus was on getting the game to work. After having the login functions
working correctly, I focused on the game itself. I quickly realized that I was
unaware of how to pass functions values. Once that concept clicked, the rest
was fairly simple. The coding for the game was done in a couple days and the
rest of the time was spent on design.

I used bootstrap and CSS to make my page look the way it does. It was easy
enough to get it to the right size. It became clear to me that the notion of
having one button change over and over again would be troublesome to implement
easily. I decided to have buttons hide and show as needed. The mobile layout was
the biggest issue I had. The images were losing their ratios and pushing text
all over the place. Once I solved that, I was able to have a functional game on
any device.
